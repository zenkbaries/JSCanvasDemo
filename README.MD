It's a demonstration of using animation with HTML5's `<canvas></canvas>` element.

### Todo:

It use ES3 Javascript so it needs to be updated to the most recent version, ES6.

Need to add documentation on how the Canvas animation workflow work. `requestAnimFrame` are used to animate the canvas contents.
